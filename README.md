# 0-1_knapsack

The problem of backpack 0-1 is a problem of ﬁnding optimal algorithms for storing data in each backpack without escaping 
its maximum capacity. In this work, an attempt was made to capture snapshots with speciﬁc values. 
The resulting ﬁles were 320 in total. The following algorithms were applied to them:
1. Greedy method
2. Comprehensive list of combinations
3. Branching and blocking
4. Dynamic Programming
5. Integer programming
6. Specialist solver
